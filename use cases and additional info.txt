This is a database and GUI-based project, hence we will be using Tkinter and sqlite3 libraries from Python. Other than this we may require some like time or SMTP as per the requirement.

Tkinter: It is the standard GUI library in python. It also provides full OOP programming support and it’s easy and fast. (YOU MIGHT HAVE TO DOWNLOAD THIS),
sqlite3: SQLite3 can be integrated with Python using the sqlite3 module. It provides an SQL interface compliant.
